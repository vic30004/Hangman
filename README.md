# About the game

The theme that I will be using for my game is Netflix. 

I will pick a couple of original Netflix shows and the user will have the guess these shows. 

Since the theme is a Netflix theme, I will try to emulate the colors and font as much as possible. 
    Important note: I was unable to replicate the font, since it's a proprietary font that Netflix license. Instead the font I will use is custom google font called Bungee Inline. 

If the user guesses the show correctly, the Image of netflix UI will update to a Youtube video. The video will be the season one trailer of that show. 

When the game ends, either by win or loss, a reset button will appear. The player will have to click on the reset button to reset the game. If the player wins and click on the reset button, the wins will not be affected.

The game will track the letters that the player guesses. The letters that can be used also include numbers. This is because some shows on Netflix have numbers in the titles. If I ever add them in these shows in the future, I will not have to change the code. 

The player will have onl 13 guesses to get the name right. If all gusesses are wrong the reset button will appear and the player will be able to reset the game.
